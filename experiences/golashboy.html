<h1>This is My First Hacktober Fest</h1>
<p> Hi,I am golashboy a highly motivated, fast learner, focused, tech enthusiastic fresher, possessing leadership skills and, having a Bachelor of Engineering degree in Computer Science Engineering. I just started contributing and made 3 pull requests.This is my 4th contribution to this repository.This was an amazing experience.
    I got to learn how to create pull requests ,and to contibute as well.I started with my preptember which was really amazing and I got motivation from that. 
</p>

<p> I learned git and github completely during this.I did not have an experience prior to this,which is why i always thought it as a difficult one. But honestly it took me just a day to 
    get familiar with this!
</p>
<p> Only thing i have to say to all others like me ,that do it,work for it. Its never to late.Practice makes a man perfect!</p>
